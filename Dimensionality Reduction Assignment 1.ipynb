    "1. **Overfitting:** In high-dimensional spaces, the curse of dimensionality heightens the risk of overfitting. The abundance of features allows models to capture noise and randomness in the data, making them overly complex and tailored to the training dataset. This complexity can lead to poor generalization, where the model doesn't perform well on new, unseen data. \n",

    "2. **Underfitting:** The curse of dimensionality can also contribute to underfitting. When there are too many features relative to the amount of data, models may struggle to understand meaningful patterns, resulting in overly simplistic representations. Sparse, high-dimensional spaces can make it challenging for models to capture the true data structure, leading to underfitting.\n",
